### Lists
1. Write a Python program to find the largest number in a given list.
2. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
3. Write a Python program to reverse a list without using the `reverse()` method.
4. Given a list of numbers, write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers.
### Loops
5. Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.
6. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
7. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and keeps asking until they enter a positive number.
### If-Else Statements
10. Write a Python program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
11. Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
12. Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest one.
13. Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.
14. Write a Python program to check if a character is a vowel or consonant.
### Strings
15. Write a Python program to count the number of vowels in a given string.
16. Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
17. Write a Python program to reverse a string without using slicing (`[::-1]`).
18. Write a program to remove all spaces from a string.
19. Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific word in a string.
### Functions
